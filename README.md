# Web-Scrapping

## README

### Overview

This project is a web scraping tool designed to extract product information from e-commerce websites such as Big Basket and Flipkart Grocery. The tool uses Python, Selenium WebDriver, BeautifulSoup, and other libraries to navigate through web pages and gather data efficiently. However, there are several considerations and vulnerabilities to keep in mind when using this tool.

### Key Features

- Scrapes product information from category pages.
- Uses Selenium WebDriver for dynamic content loading.
- Implements BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content.
- Stores scraped data in CSV format.

### Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language used for scripting.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Used for handling dynamic content and interactions with web pages.
- **BeautifulSoup (bs4)**: For parsing HTML and extracting data.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to web pages.
- **CSV**: For exporting the scraped data.
- **re**: For regular expression operations.

### Usage

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries (`selenium`, `beautifulsoup4`, `requests`, etc.).
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script to start scraping.
3. **Configuration**: Modify the URLs, headers, and other settings as needed to match the target website structure.

### Vulnerabilities and Considerations

1. **HTML Content Dependency**: 
   - The scraping efficiency is highly dependent on the structure of HTML content. If tag names or class names change on the target website, the script will fail to scrape the details.
   - **Action**: Before scraping, verify that the HTML structure (tag names and class names) remains consistent.

2. **Using Headers**:
   - When not using Selenium, ensure to include headers in your requests. This helps in accessing the website without getting blocked.
   - **Action**: Implement appropriate headers to mimic browser requests.

3. **Product Availability**:
   - If a product is not available, its details will be missing.
   - **Action**: Implement checks to handle missing product data gracefully.

4. **Category URL Changes**:
   - The tool uses category links to scrape all products. If the format of the URL or the category name changes, it may not access the category.
   - **Action**: Regularly verify and update category links to match the website's current structure.

### Problems Faced in Big Basket

1. **Dynamic Product Loading**:
   - Products load dynamically. Without Selenium, scraping stops at around 50 products. Selenium helps to increase the count effectively.
   - **Action**: Use Selenium for better handling of dynamic content.

2. **Weight or Unit Information**:
   - Weight or unit information is not consistently provided in a specific segment. The script scrapes it from tabs and titles.
   - **Action**: still on it.....

### Problems Faced in Flipkart Grocery

1. **Pagination**:
   - Products are distributed page-wise (~40-50 per page). The script uses BeautifulSoup to change URLs. If the class name for the next page changes, it will fail to scrape all products.
   - **Action**: Monitor and update the class names for pagination as they change.

2. **Location and Signup Requirements**:
   - Flipkart Grocery requires location input or signup to show all details. This can result in missing data if these requirements are not met.
   - **Action**: Automate location input and handle the changes in URL to maintain consistency.

3. **Location Handling**:
   - When the URL changes, the location is reset, leading to inconsistent data.
   - **Action**: Implement a method to maintain location data or automate re-entry as needed.

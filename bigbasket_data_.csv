It all begins with the leaf. The better the leaf, the better the powder. Shade-grown, nutrient-rich young Tencha green tea leaves are steamed, deveined, destemmed, dried and stone-ground into fine Matcha powder which is then consumed with water, ultimately leading to ingestion of whole tea leaves, making Matcha an extremely potent form of green tea or the ‘elixir of the immortals’ as popularly known. A single serving of Matcha is considered equivalent to at least 10 cups of brewed green tea. A study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that drinking Matcha tea regularly results in significant reduction of body fat, enhanced mental function, improved immunity and anxiety relief.

The non-alcoholic drink is a flavorful combination of the best grapefruits and other sophisticated hand-picked citruses, along with an equally captivating zesty perfume! The premium drink is perfectly balanced and may be consumed on its own or as a mixer to add flavour to other cocktails. It makes a good partner for spirits or a chic drink all by itself! Drinks, especially gin and tonics, frequently contain tonic or flavoured tonic water. Moreover, coffee can also be had with flavoured tonic water. Tonic water is taken for its distinct bitter flavour and was previously employed as a malaria prophylactic but is now routinely sweetened. It normally has a much-reduced quinine dosage. This grapefruit tonic water takes you on a voyage of delicate sweetness, tangy flavour, with a touch of bitterness reminiscent of freshly squeezed grapefruit. The strong and crisp tonic water is equally amazing when savoured on its own as it is when blended with liquor. Thus explore the range of Tipsy J's tonic water only on Big Basket and up your drinking game. Make fun, unique, and exotic cocktails at home and enjoy your evenings. The variety has something for everyone's liking and can be your perfect unwinding drink.","EAN Code: 8908018663014  FSSAI: 13321999000866  Manufactured & Marketed by: Patel Beverages Private Limited, No:505/2, 3-4, GIDC Estate, Makarpura, Vadodara, Gujarat - 390 010 & GoodTimes & Co., D-54, Ground Floor, Hauz Khas, New Delhi - 110 016.

Moringa is naturally abundant with nutrition, rich in essential amino acids which are the building blocks of proteins and numerous other health benefits. The Wonders of Hibiscus: Hibiscus petals, naturally rich in Vitamin C and iron, provide a purifying and healing energy. Hibiscus has a sweet and astringent taste, or rasa, and a cooling virya, or energetic effect on the body. Ayurveda also uses the bright, healing qualities of Hibiscus flowers to support the heart and circulatory system, recognizing their ability to purify the blood, promote a clear, glowing complexion, and uplift the heart (both physically and spiritually).

This tea flush comes with a sweet touch of muscatel that truly is a connoisseur’s delight.
Product Information:

Darjeeling Second Flush Tea yields its finest quality after spring. Carefully handpicked during the months of May and June, the tea leaves of the Second Flush have beautiful purplish blooms.
In contrast to the First Flush, this yield retains a darker amber hue and a stronger, fuller body, but with a smoother finish.
Savoured worldwide as one of the best Darjeeling teas, it boasts a unique, sweet, and fruity muscatel grape flavour.
This is a second harvest seasonal, smooth & strong cup of tea, best enjoyed without milk. The unique Muscatel flavour is a 'prized find' for the Darjeeling Tea planter during the May-June period each year.


Appearance: Amber hue; more intensity and colour than the First Flush variant.
Taste Note: Mature, fruity, full-bodied, and wine-like, owing to the muscatel flavour.
It is an ideal tea for everyday drinking as well as for gifting on special occasions such as Ganpati, Raksha Bandhan, Diwali, birthdays, anniversaries, and housewarming.","EAN Code: 8901030662287 FSSAI Number: 10013022001897  Manufacturer Name : Hindustan Unilever Ltd.,  Plot No. A- 8/9, MIDC - Malegaon, Taluka - Sinnar, Nasik - 422103 Maharashtra & Marketed by: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), Unilever House,  B.

In South India, it may be used in stir-fries or added to coconut-based curries. Cabbage is also pickled or fermented as ""gobi ka achar"" or ""gobi ki kanji,"" respectively, adding tanginess to meals. Its affordability and long shelf life make it a household favourite across India.

Whether in aromatic curries, spicy chutneys, or tempered dals, garlic's distinctive taste is essential. Beyond its culinary role, garlic is also valued for its symbolism in traditional medicine and rituals.
